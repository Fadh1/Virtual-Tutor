PyMC3 is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning
focusing on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI)
algorithms. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a
large suite of problems.

Check out the `getting started guide <http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started>`__,  or
`interact with live examples <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pymc-devs/pymc3/master?filepath=%2Fdocs%2Fsource%2Fnotebooks>`__
using Binder!

Features
========

-  Intuitive model specification syntax, for example, ``x ~ N(0,1)``
   translates to ``x = Normal('x',0,1)``
-  **Powerful sampling algorithms**, such as the `No U-Turn
   Sampler <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/hoffman14a.html>`__, allow complex models
   with thousands of parameters with little specialized knowledge of
   fitting algorithms.
-  **Variational inference**: `ADVI <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-107.html>`__
   for fast approximate posterior estimation as well as mini-batch ADVI
   for large data sets.
-  Relies on `Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>`__ which provides:
    *  Computation optimization and dynamic C compilation
    *  Numpy broadcasting and advanced indexing
    *  Linear algebra operators
    *  Simple extensibility
-  Transparent support for missing value imputation

Getting started
===============

If you already know about Bayesian statistics:
----------------------------------------------


-  `API quickstart guide <http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/api_quickstart>`__
-  The `PyMC3 tutorial <http://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/getting_started>`__
-  `PyMC3 examples <https://docs.pymc.io/nb_examples/index.html>`__ and the `API reference <http://docs.pymc.io/api>`__



Learn Bayesian statistics with a book together with PyMC3:
----------------------------------------------------------

-  `Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers>`__: Fantastic book with many applied code examples.
-  `PyMC3 port of the book "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" by John Kruschke <https://github.com/aloctavodia/Doing_bayesian_data_analysis>`__ as well as the `second edition <https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/DBDA-python>`__: Principled introduction to Bayesian data analysis.
-  `PyMC3 port of the book "Statistical Rethinking A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan" by Richard McElreath <https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking>`__
-  `PyMC3 port of the book "Bayesian Cognitive Modeling" by Michael Lee and EJ Wagenmakers <https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/BCM>`__: Focused on using Bayesian statistics in cognitive modeling.
-  `Bayesian Analysis with Python  <https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bayesian-analysis-python-second-edition>`__ (second edition) by Osvaldo Martin: Great introductory book. (`code <https://github.com/aloctavodia/BAP>`__ and errata).

PyMC3 talks
-----------

There are also several talks on PyMC3 which are gathered in this `YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1Ma_1DBbE82OVW8Fz_6Ts1oOeyOAiovy>`__

Installation
============

The latest release of PyMC3 can be installed from PyPI using ``pip``:

::

    pip install pymc3

**Note:** Running ``pip install pymc`` will install PyMC 2.3, not PyMC3,
from PyPI.

Or via conda-forge:

::

    conda install -c conda-forge pymc3

Plotting is done using `ArviZ <https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/>`__
which may be installed separately, or along with PyMC3:

::

    pip install pymc3[plots]

The current development branch of PyMC3 can be installed from GitHub, also using ``pip``:

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3

To ensure the development branch of Theano is installed alongside PyMC3
(recommended), you can install PyMC3 using the ``requirements.txt``
file. This requires cloning the repository to your computer:

::

    git clone https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3
    cd pymc3
    pip install -r requirements.txt

However, if a recent version of Theano has already been installed on
your system, you can install PyMC3 directly from GitHub.

Another option is to clone the repository and install PyMC3 using
``python setup.py install`` or ``python setup.py develop``.


Dependencies
============

PyMC3 is tested on Python 3.6 and depends on Theano, NumPy,
SciPy, and Pandas (see ``requirements.txt`` for version
information).

Optional
--------

In addtion to the above dependencies, the GLM submodule relies on
`Patsy <http://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
